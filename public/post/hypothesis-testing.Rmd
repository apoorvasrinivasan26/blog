Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I've started this blog to think through various statistical concepts and techniques and hopefully they'll be useful to you too! Let's start with every statisticians favorite flex: hypothesis testing

There's two main branches of statistics. One, where we analyze and summarize the data we have.  Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. This is called inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is an important part of it.  It can be confusing because there are endless terminilogies and rules to keep in mind but we can tackle it by breaking it down into smaller parts. Let's get started!

It starts with a hypothesis.

## what is hypothesis?

A hypothesis is simply just a question about something in the world around you that can be tested, either by experiment or observation. For example, you may be interested in knowing

* Does this medicine work better than the other? 
* Are women better at multitasking than men? 
* Will putting on a hat make me more productive?
* Does coffee stunt your growth?

Let's say you're interested in finding out if coffee stunts your growth. Instead of collecting real data, we just simulate data for adolescent coffee drinkers, assuming a real effect of Cohen’s $\ d = 7/15$


```{r}
set.seed(666)
 
x <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y1 <- rnorm(50, mean = 175, sd = 15)
y2 <- rnorm(50, mean = 170, sd = 15)	 	
dat <- data.frame(y = c(y1, y2), x = x)
	
boxplot(y ~ x, dat, col = c('red', 'grey'),
        xlab = 'coffee drinking status', ylab = 'height')

```

It seems like the the sample mean height of people that drink coffee is lower than those who don't. Does that conclude our study? Should we call it a day?


## why use hypothesis tests?

Let’s take a step back for a moment and restate why we should use a hypothesis test rather than just use the sample means to decide. Samples are a subset of the entire population. Sample statistics, such as the mean, are unlikely to equal the actual population values. The difference between the sample value and the population value is called sample error. If sample error causes the observed difference, the next time someone performs the same experiment the results might be different. Hypothesis testing incorporates estimates of the sampling error to help you make the correct decision.


## template for conducting hypothesis testing

Now that it's clear why we should be doing hypothesis testing. Below is a rough template to carry out hypothesis testing. 

1. Explicitly define the population parameter of interest.
2. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
3. State the significance level of the test.
4. State the form of the test statistic and its null distribution
5. State the decision rule and/or compute the p-value and make a decision.
6. State your conclusions in the context of the problem.


### 1) explicitly define the population parameter of interest.

A population parameter of interest is the value(usually mean) we're hypothesizing on with our data. In our case, the population parameter of interest is 

$\mu$ = mean height for adolescent coffee drinkers

### 2) state the null and alternative hypotheses.


In general terms the hypothesis can be: 


The __null hypothesis__, denoted by $H_0$, is a claim about a population characteristic that we initially assumed to be true. 

The __alternative hypothesis__, denoted by $H_1$, is the competing claim (we often set up hypotheses in hopes of showing that $H_1$ is true).


In carrying out a hypothesis test of $H_0$ versus $H_1$, the hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected in favor of $H_1$ only if sample evidence strongly suggests that $H_0$ is false. If the sample does not provide such evidence, then $H_0$ is not rejected.


Therefore the two possible __outcomes__ of a hypothesis test are _reject $H_0$_ or _fail to reject $H_0$_ (in some cases we say “fail to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$”).

 :exclamation: :exclamation: failing to reject H0 does not mean that we accept H0. :exclamation: :exclamation: 
 
 
:pencil: Many people have found an analogy between hypothesis testig and court room to be useful where 

* A hypothesis test is like holding a trial (going to court)
* $H_0$ is assumed true (innocent) until ”proven” otherwise (guilty)
* We have evidence to help us come to a decision (verdict)
* Possible outcomes: Reject $H_0$ (guilty) or fail to reject $H_0$ (not guilty)


Below is the general form in which you can set up your hypothesis

<img src="/post/hypothesis-testing_files/hypothesis_table.png" alt="final image" width="800" class="center"/>


In the context of our example, 

$H_0$: $\mu_c$ = $\mu_{nc}$

$H_1$ = $\mu_c$ $\neq$ $\mu_{nc}$

where $\mu_c$ = mean height of the coffee drinking population and
$\mu_nc$ = mean height of the population that doesn't drink coffee


        
### 3) state the significance level of the test


Once hypotheses have been formulated, we need a method for using sample data to determine whether $H_0$ should be rejected or not. The method that we use is called a test procedure. Unfortunately, just as a jury may reach the wrong verdict in a trial, there is some chance that the use of a test procedure based on sample data may lead us to the wrong conclusion about a population characteristic.


Type 1 error = $P(reject H_0 / H_0 is true)$


Type 2 error = $P(fail to reject H_0 / H_1 is true)$


In keeping with the jury example, 

Type 1 error ==> say guilty, when in fact, not guilty

Type 2 error ==> say not guilty, when in fact, guilty


:heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark: Neglecting to think adequately about possible consequences of Type I and Type II errors can lead to severe consequence. this trade off should be made based on the context of the problem :heavy_exclamation_mark: :heavy_exclamation_mark:

<img src="/post/hypothesis-testing_files/errors_redone.png" alt="final image" width="800" class="center"/>

_but what does setting a significance level mean?_

It represents our tolerance for type 1 error. It's usually repesented by $\alpha$. Ideally, we want to choose a significance level that minimizes the likelihood of one of these errors.i.e. a very small significance level. Significance levels such as 0.05 and 0.01 are common in most fields.


### 4) state the form of the test statistic and its null distribution


Now that we know the possible errors that we can make and how we should control them, we need to figure out exactly what it is that we mean by “evidence against $H_0$”.

Evidence against the null hypothesis comes in the form of a __test statistic__, TS. A test statistic is a summary statistic that is a function of the sample data on which the conclusion to reject or fail to reject H0 is based. The most common types of test statistics are Z and t test statistic. [Here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/statistical-tests/) is a link to a comprehensive list


### 5) state the decision rule and/or compute the p-value and make a decision.

Another important part of any hypothesis test is the __decision rule__. The decision rule is a procedure that tells us when to reject or not to reject H0 and is based on the test statistic.  Statisticians describe these decision rules in two ways - with reference to a P-value or with reference to a region of acceptance

The range of values over which we do not reject H0 is called the __acceptance region__. The range of values over which we reject H0 is called the __rejection region__. The number that divides the acceptance and rejection regions is called the __critical value__.

However, in practice, most statisticians/ researchers make the decision by computing p-values. Keep in mind p-values are widely misconstructed in the literature. Go through [this link](http://www.perfendo.org/docs/BayesProbability/twelvePvaluemisconceptions.pdf) for common misconceptions and how to avoid them.


### 6) state your conclusions in the context of the problem.

Circling back to our example, we take the p-value route to make a decision. Because the t-test is simply a general linear model with one categorical predictor, we can run:


```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x, dat))
```

Putting it in an equation, we can say $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon$

In the R output, (Intercept) is $\beta_0$ while x is $\beta_1$. $\beta_0$ is the mean of the group in which our categorical predictor is 0, i.e. the group which does not drink coffee. The group that does drink coffee, on the other hand, has a mean decrease in height of ~5 cm. However, since the p-value is 0.107 We would conclude that the probability of observing these data or more extreme data given that there really is no effect is ~10%. Using the conventional cutoff, $\alpha = 0.05$, we would say that we fail to reject our null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two groups.
