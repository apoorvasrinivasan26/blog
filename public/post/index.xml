      <description>In this blogpost, I will:
 Describe functional programming concepts Write functional programming code using purrr package in R  As the field of data science evolves, it has become clear that software development skills are essential for producing useful data science results and products. Even in research, learning to think computationally can help bridge the systemic skill gap between the discipline and the technology. For many (including myself), the focus is primarily on data science, statistics, and programming on a smaller scale early on in their data science journey.</description>

      <description>As a recent graduate, I spent a better part of this year applying and interviewing for data science jobs. By going through a process of hundreds of applications, a dozen phone screens and four final rounds of interviews, I have accumulated a significant amount of resources and questions that have helped me prepare and land my dream data scientist role. Organized by categorizies, you will find over 50 interview questions along with some resources to help you brush up your skills and crush that interview!</description>

      <description>In my previous post, we spoke about hypothesis testing from a frequentist perspective. This is the method that is commonly taught in STAT101 classes. But for many decades, some statisticians have argued for another approach to conduct statistical analysis based on bayes theorem.
As someone who is new to this approach to statistics, my goal in this blogpost is to break down what I’ve learned about the basics of bayesian inference in a way that is (hopefully) easy to follow along if you’re familiar with frequentist methods.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I’ve started this blog to think through various statistical concepts and techniques and hopefully they’ll be useful to you too. Let’s start with every statisticians favorite flex: hypothesis testing
There’s two main branches of statistics. One, where we analyze and summarize the data we have. Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. This is called inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is an important part of it.</description>

      <description>One common question that’s on everyone’s minds as we fiercely scrub our hands, pool our resources, conserve our consumption, stock up (but not hoard), invent calculus or write King Lear is: when will this end? Nobody knows what the answer to that question is but we are all in agreement that it could be in the faraway promise land of vaccines.
Although vaccination now is a common method to provide long-term protection against a disease, it was unheard of until about 200 years ago.</description>
