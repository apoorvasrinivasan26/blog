      <description>There’s two main branches of statistics. One, where we collect and summarize the data we have. Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. Hypothesis testing is one way to make that inference and so it is called inferential statistics. It can be confusing because there are endless terminilogies and rules to keep in mind but we can tackle it by breaking it down into smaller parts.</description>

      <description>One common question that’s on everyone’s minds as we fiercely scrub our hands, pool our resources, conserve our consumption, stock up (but not hoard), invent calculus or write King Lear is: when will this end? Nobody knows what the answer to that question is but we are all in agreement that it could be in the faraway promise land of vaccines.
Although vaccination now is a common method to provide long-term protection against a disease, it was unheard of until about 200 years ago.</description>
