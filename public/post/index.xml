      <description>Based on the team, role and organization, data science interviews may widely vary where
Machine Learning How can you make sure that you don’t analyze something that ends up meaningless?
 Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.
 What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?
 What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I accepted a data scientist position at the Auerbach Lab at the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry. For the last year, I have taken interest in computational psychiatry and working on how machine learning models can help amelierate certain mental health conditions. In this blogpost, I want to take a broader perspective and address some of the areas where data science can help advance our understanding of mental health.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, we spoke about hypothesis testing from a frequentist perspective. This is the method that is commonly taught in STAT101 classes. But for many decades, some statisticians have argued for another approach to conduct statistical analysis based on bayes theorem.
As someone who is new to this approach to statistics, my goal in this blogpost is to break down what I’ve learned about the basics of bayesian inference in a way that is (hopefully) easy to follow along if you’re familiar with frequentist methods.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I’ve started this blog to think through various statistical concepts and techniques and hopefully they’ll be useful to you too. Let’s start with every statisticians favorite flex: hypothesis testing
There’s two main branches of statistics. One, where we analyze and summarize the data we have. Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. This is called inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is an important part of it.</description>

      <description>One common question that’s on everyone’s minds as we fiercely scrub our hands, pool our resources, conserve our consumption, stock up (but not hoard), invent calculus or write King Lear is: when will this end? Nobody knows what the answer to that question is but we are all in agreement that it could be in the faraway promise land of vaccines.
Although vaccination now is a common method to provide long-term protection against a disease, it was unheard of until about 200 years ago.</description>
