      <description>Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I’ve started this blog to think through various statistical concepts and techniques and hopefully they’ll be useful to you too. Let’s start with every statisticians favorite flex: hypothesis testing
There’s two main branches of statistics. One, where we analyze and summarize the data we have. Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. This is called inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is an important part of it.</description>

      <description>One common question that’s on everyone’s minds as we fiercely scrub our hands, pool our resources, conserve our consumption, stock up (but not hoard), invent calculus or write King Lear is: when will this end?

Although vaccination now is a common method to provide long-term protection against a disease, it was unheard of until about 200 years ago.</description>
