      <description>In this blogpost, I will:
 Describe functional programming concepts Write functional programming code using purrr package in R  As the field of data science evolves, it has become clear that software development skills are essential for producing useful data science results and products.

      <description>As a recent graduate, I spent a better part of this year applying and interviewing for data science jobs. By going through a process of hundreds of applications, a dozen phone screens and four final rounds of interviews, I have accumulated a significant amount of resources and questions that have helped me prepare and land my dream data scientist role. Organized by categorizies, you will find over 50 interview questions along with some resources to help you brush up your skills and crush that interview!</description>
