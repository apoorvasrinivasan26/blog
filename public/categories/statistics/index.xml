      <description>In my previous post, we spoke about hypothesis testing from a frequentist perspective. If you took a stats class, that is the method you probably learn. There is another, arguably better method to conduct a hypothesis testing and that using bayesian inference.
My goal in this blogpost is to break down the basics of bayesian inference.
This blogpost assumes prior knowledge on conditional, marginal and random variable concepts.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my brand new website! I’ve started this blog to think through various statistical concepts and techniques and hopefully they’ll be useful to you too. Let’s start with every statisticians favorite flex: hypothesis testing
There’s two main branches of statistics. One, where we analyze and summarize the data we have. Other where we infer stuff about a population based on some sample data we collect. This is called inferential statistics and hypothesis testing is an important part of it.</description>
