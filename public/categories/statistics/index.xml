      <description>THIS IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLESE CHECK BACK LATER
If there’s anything statisticians love to talk about its hypothesis testing. In this post, we will talk about everything you need to get started with hypothesis testing. There are a lot of rules and terminilogy to keep in mind while doing it but it’s going to be easy when we break it down into smaller parts.
This blogpost is meant for people getting started with statistics.</description>
