      <description>For many decades, randomized controlled trials have been the gold standard for clinical trials. You take a group of people with some condition, and you randomly assign each of those people to one of two (or more) treatment groups. These groups are then compared on a predefined measured response. Ideally, noone – not the researcher, not the patients – knows who is in which group until the end of the study.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, we spoke about hypothesis testing from a frequentist perspective. This is the method that is commonly taught in STAT101 classes. But for many decades, some statisticians have argued for another approach to conduct statistical analysis based on bayes theorem.
As someone who is new to this approach to statistics, my goal in this blogpost is to break down what I’ve learned about the basics of bayesian inference in a way that is (hopefully) easy to follow along if you’re familiar with frequentist methods.</description>
