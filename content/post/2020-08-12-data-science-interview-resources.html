<div id="predictive-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1>Predictive Modeling</h1>
<p>Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.</p>
<p>What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?</p>
<p>What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?</p>
<p>What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error, versus a model that minimizes absolute error? In which cases would each error metric be appropriate?</p>
<p>What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced? What if there are more than 2 groups?</p>
<p>What is regularization and where might it be helpful? What is an example of using regularization in a model?</p>
