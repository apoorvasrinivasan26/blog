THIS IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLESE CHECK BACK LATER


If there's anything statisticians love to talk about its hypothesis testing. In this post, we will talk about everything you need to get started with hypothesis testing.

This blog is meant for people getting started with statistics. Turns out, even those with some experience in statistics can find use in it


```{r echo=FALSE}

Before you get into tetsing, let's talk aout what hypothesis is

## what is hypothesis??

A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around you. It should be testable, either by experiment or observation. For example, you may be interested in knowing

* Does this medicine work better than the other? 
* Will my students score more with this new method of teaching? 
* Are women better at multitasking than men? 
* Does chocolate have an effect on athletic performance? 
* Does eating jelly bean cause acne? 
* Does coffee stunt your growth?

Let's focus on the last hypothesis.

Imagine we sampled data from a population of young adults that drink coffee vs those that dont.


Lets say the height of an adolescent boy that drnks coffee is 175 and someone who doesnt is lower

In general terms the hypothesis can be:


The null hypothesis, denoted by H0, is a claim about a population characteristic that we initially
assume to be true 



Let's generate data!
