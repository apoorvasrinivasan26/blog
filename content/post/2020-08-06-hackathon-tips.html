<p>Two weeks ago, I accepted a data scientist position at the Auerbach Lab at the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry. For the last year, I have taken interest in computational psychiatry and working on how machine learning models can help amelierate certain mental health conditions. In this blogpost, I want to take a broader perspective and address some of the areas where data science can help advance our understanding of mental health.</p>
