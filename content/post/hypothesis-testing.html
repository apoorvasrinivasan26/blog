<p>Before you get into tetsing, let’s talk aout what hypothesis is</p>
<div id="what-is-hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>what is hypothesis??</h2>
<p>A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around you. It should be testable, either by experiment or observation. For example, you may be interested in knowing</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this medicine work better than the other?</li>
<li>Will my students score more with this new method of teaching?</li>
<li>Are women better at multitasking than men?</li>
<li>Does chocolate have an effect on athletic performance?</li>
<li>Does eating jelly bean cause acne?</li>
<li>Does coffee stunt your growth?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s focus on the last hypothesis.</p>
<p>Imagine we sampled data from a population of young adults that drink coffee vs those that dont.</p>
<p>Lets say the height of an adolescent boy that drnks coffee is 175 and someone who doesnt is lower</p>
<p>In general terms the hypothesis can be:</p>
<p>The null hypothesis, denoted by H0, is a claim about a population characteristic that we initially
assume to be true</p>
<p>Let’s generate data!</p>
