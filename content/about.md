title: about me
---

Hello! My name is Apoorva. I'm currently building [CurieLabs](https://www.curielabs.net/). Previously, I've built machine learning algorithms for early cancer detection at [Intervenn](https://intervenn.com/) and detecting depression using passive sensor data from smartphones at [Columbia University](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/).

I'm passionate about ML/AI in biotech and healthcare, making tools for accelerating science and increasing access to education. I'm also an [avid reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28709194-apoorva-srinivasan) and a yoga instructor. I live in San Francisco with my cat, Softmax.  


You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apoorvasriniva) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/apoorvasrinivasan26).
