title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Apoorva.  I'm a data scientist at Intervenn Biosciences where I work on detecting various diseases early with blood samples. Previously, I worked on detecting depression early with passive sensor smartphone data at the [Auerbach Lab](https://www.auerbachlab.com) at Columbia University Department of Psychiatry. My educational background is in biostatistics from Columbia University and biotechnology engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, India.

I'm especially interested in computational biology, making the tools for doing science better, and reshaping our scientific institutions. I'm also an obsessive reader and a yoga instructor.
