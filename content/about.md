title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Apoorva. I'm currently building CurieLabs. Previously, I've built algorithms for early cancer detection at [Intervenn](https://intervenn.com/) and for detecting depression using passive sensor data from smartphones at [Columbia University](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/). 


I'm passionate about computational biology, making the tools for accelerating science and increasing access to education. I'm also an [avid reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28709194-apoorva-srinivasan) and a yoga instructor. 


You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apoorvasriniva) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/apoorvasrinivasan26)
